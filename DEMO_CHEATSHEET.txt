COMMANDS
--------
Validate:  python validate_setup.py
Demo:      python demo.py
Graph:     python show_graph.py

-----------------
race_engineer.py:17   - TypedDict (state management)
race_engineer.py:26   - Telemetry Agent
race_engineer.py:66   - Analysis Agent (regression)
race_engineer.py:131  - Engineer Agent

ibt_parser.py:17      - Graceful degradation pattern

OPENING HOOK (30 sec)
---------------------
"I built a multi-agent optimization system to find 3 tenths at Bristol.
The constraint was determinism - safety-critical recommendations can't vary.
That ruled out most frameworks and led me to LangGraph. Let me show why."

FIVE TECHNICAL GEMS TO DROP
----------------------------

1. TYPE SAFETY (race_engineer.py:17)
   "TypedDict gives compile-time checking with runtime flexibility.
   Optional[] fields populate as state flows. IDE autocomplete, mypy
   validation, self-documenting contracts."

2. FEATURE SCALING (race_engineer.py:100-103)
   "StandardScaler normalizes to zero mean, unit variance. Without it,
   PSI (25-35) and weight (50-60%) have incomparable coefficients.
   After scaling, -0.08 vs -0.03 means 2.7x more important."

3. CONDITIONAL ROUTING (race_engineer.py:176)
   "First-class error handling at graph level. If telemetry fails,
   route to error node, not crash. In CrewAI, I'd need manual try-catch
   everywhere. LangGraph makes failure modes structural."

4. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION (ibt_parser.py:17)
   "Import-level feature flags. With pyirsdk: parse real 12MB binary files.
   Without: use mock data. One codebase works in prod, CI/CD, and demos.
   Inspired by feature flags but at import level."

5. WHY LANGGRAPH (30 seconds)
   "Evaluated LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen. Deciding factor: determinism.
   Same input must give same output for safety. LangGraph's explicit
   state graph guarantees this. CrewAI/AutoGen use LLMs which vary.
   Great for creative tasks, wrong for numerical optimization."

THREE LIMITATIONS TO MENTION
-----------------------------
1. "No confidence intervals - need bootstrap resampling for uncertainty"
2. "Linear only - would add polynomial features for interactions"
3. "Batch processing - real-time would need StreamingAgent"

Production Ready    ✓        ~       X

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
-------------------

Q: "How would you handle hyperparameter tuning?"
A: "Add HyperparameterAgent before AnalysisAgent. Grid search with
   5-fold CV, cache results. For more params, Bayesian with Optuna."

Q: "What about overfitting with small data?"
A: "20 samples, 8 features = risky. Mitigation: L2 regularization (Ridge),
   feature selection (LASSO), cross-validation (LOOCV), domain constraints."

Q: "How do you version models?"
A: "LangGraph checkpointing + MLflow. Add 'model_version' to TypedDict,
   pickle artifacts with semantic versions, A/B test, keep last N for rollback."

Q: "Why not neural nets?"
A: "Three reasons: Data efficiency (need 100s), interpretability (linear
   coefficients explain why), reliability (deterministic). Would try NN
   with 500+ sessions, but linear is 80% of value."

Q: "Why not just use a notebook?"
A: "Notebooks great for exploration, poor for production. No state mgmt,
   no reusability, can't unit test, no orchestration. Agents give modular,
   testable, CI/CD-friendly components. Explored in notebook, productionized
   as agents."

DEMO STRUCTURE (15 min)
------------------------
1. Hook + Architecture (3 min) - Show TypedDict, explain graph
2. Why LangGraph (2 min) - Determinism requirement, alternatives
3. Statistical Rigor (3 min) - StandardScaler, interpretability
4. Run Demo (1 min) - Let it run, narrate stages
5. Production Patterns (2 min) - Error handling, testing, degradation
6. Extensibility (2 min) - Add tire wear agent live
7. Limitations (1 min) - Be honest about gaps
8. Q&A Setup (1 min) - Invite deeper exploration

POWER PHRASES
-------------
"Notice the type safety here..."
"This pattern is reusable across domains..."
"I chose X over Y because..."
"The constraint drove this design..."
"Current limitation is X. In production I'd..."
"Great question. Let me show you..."

CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS
-------------------
✓ Everything validated and tested
✓ Demo runs in 5 seconds reliably
✓ You understand every line of code
✓ You've evaluated alternatives
✓ You know the limitations
✓ You can extend it live

EMERGENCY BACKUP
----------------
If demo fails:
1. python validate_setup.py (diagnose)
2. Show output/demo_results.json (previous run)
3. Walk through code architecture
4. Offer to debug live with them

META-MESSAGE
------------
"I learn fast" - Non-technical to binary parsing
"I think like engineer" - Types, tests, docs
"I understand trade-offs" - Every choice has rationale
"I build for production" - Not just demos
"I know gaps" - Honest about limitations

THE CLOSING
-----------
"To summarize: LangGraph-based workflow with typed state, statistical
rigor with proper scaling, production patterns for reliability,
trivial extensibility, self-aware about limitations.

This was a 3-day project to learn agent orchestration. I'd love to
apply this to [COMPANY]'s problems. Happy to dive deeper into any
aspect - stats, architecture, deployment, whatever interests you most."

REMEMBER
--------
→ Show graph first (architecture before code)
→ Explain WHY not just WHAT
→ Mention limitations before they ask
→ Connect to their use cases
→ Stay calm and confident

YOU GOT THIS! 🏁
