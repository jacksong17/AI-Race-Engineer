              BRISTOL AI RACE ENGINEER - TIMING REFERENCE CARD
                      Print This & Keep Next to You
================================================================================

SLIDE 1: TITLE + HOOK (0:00-0:30)
----------------------------------
"Multi-agent system to find 0.3s at Bristol. Constraint: deterministic,
safety-critical recommendations. Led me to LangGraph."

SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:30-1:30)
---------------------------------
"8 parameters, non-linear interactions. Traditional guides are generic.
Key constraint: deterministic recommendations for safety."

SLIDE 3: SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE (1:30-3:00)
-------------------------------------------
"Three agents: Telemetry Chief (parse 12MB binary files), Data Scientist
(StandardScaler + regression), Crew Chief (interpret → recommend)."

SLIDE 4: WORKFLOW GRAPH (3:00-5:00)
------------------------------------
"Conditional routing (error handling is structural). Type-safe state.
Deterministic execution. Different from CrewAI autonomy."

SLIDE 5: LIVE DEMO (5:00-7:00)
-------------------------------
[Switch to terminal]
> python demo.py
NARRATE: "Processing 20 sessions... Running regression... Cross weight
is -0.082 = strongest predictor... Result: 0.345s improvement!"
[Switch back to PPT]

SLIDE 6: STATE MANAGEMENT (7:00-8:30)
--------------------------------------
"TypedDict = compile-time safety + runtime flexibility. Optional[] shows
pipeline evolution. Makes debugging trivial. Inspect state after any node."

SLIDE 7: STATISTICAL RIGOR (8:30-10:00)
----------------------------------------
"StandardScaler critical - makes coefficients comparable across units.
Linear for interpretability. -0.082 vs -0.032 = 2.7x more important.
Limitation: no interaction terms yet."

SLIDE 8: FRAMEWORK DECISION (10:00-11:30)
------------------------------------------
"Evaluated LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen. Deciding factor: determinism.
CrewAI great for autonomy. AutoGen great for conversation. LangGraph
optimizes for control. Right tool for constraints."

SLIDE 9: PRODUCTION PATTERNS (11:30-13:00)
-------------------------------------------
"Graceful degradation at import level. Structural error handling (not
try-catch). Comprehensive testing. Type safety throughout. For prod:
add MLflow, observability, checkpointing."

SLIDE 10: RESULTS & IMPACT (13:00-14:00)
-----------------------------------------
"0.306s faster (pole vs 6th). Cross weight 2.7x impact. Non-intuitive:
lower LF works. 5 second execution. 100% reproducible. Validated on-track."

SLIDE 11: EXTENSIBILITY (14:00-15:00)
--------------------------------------
"Add agent in 3 steps: define function, add node, wire edges. O(1) not
O(n²). Architecture reusable: manufacturing (yield), infrastructure
(performance), supply chain (routing)."

SLIDE 12: LIMITATIONS & Q&A (15:00-15:30)
------------------------------------------
"Current gaps: no confidence intervals, linear only, batch only. How I'd
fix: bootstrap, polynomial features, streaming. Production roadmap.
Questions?"

BACKUP PLANS
================================================================================

If Running Long:
  → Skip slide 9 (Production Patterns)
  → Brief on slides 6-7 (30s each instead of 90s)

If Demo Fails:
  → Show output/demo_results.json instead
  → Walk through code in race_engineer.py
  → Reference pre-run results

If Questions Come Early:
  → Answer briefly
  → "Let me show you that in slide X"
  → Stay on schedule

================================================================================
KEY MESSAGES TO HIT
================================================================================

1. "Determinism was the deciding constraint"
2. "StandardScaler makes coefficients comparable"
3. "TypedDict gives type safety with flexibility"
4. "Conditional routing is structural, not try-catch"
5. "Architecture is reusable beyond racing"

================================================================================
TRANSITIONS TO MEMORIZE
================================================================================

2→3: "Here's how I approached the solution..."
3→4: "Let me show you the actual state graph..."
4→5: "Let me show you this running live..." [SWITCH TO TERMINAL]
5→6: "Let me show you how this works under the hood..." [BACK TO PPT]
6→7: "The analysis agent is where the real intelligence lives..."
7→8: "Now, why did I choose LangGraph for this..."
8→9: "Beyond the core algorithm, production readiness requires..."
9→10: "Here's what all this engineering delivered..."
10→11: "Now, what makes this architecture reusable..."
11→12: "To wrap up, let me be honest about limitations..."

================================================================================
BODY LANGUAGE REMINDERS
================================================================================

✓ Face audience, not screen
✓ Point at screen for specific items
✓ Pause 2 seconds after key points
✓ Watch for confused faces (slow down)
✓ Gesture during demo narration
✓ Smile - show you're excited about this
✓ Stand still during key technical points

================================================================================
Q&A STRATEGY
================================================================================

Expected Questions:
  "Why not neural nets?"
  "How do you handle overfitting?"
  "What about hyperparameter tuning?"
  "How would you deploy this?"
  "Why not just use a notebook?"

→ See TECHNICAL_TALKING_POINTS.md for full answers

General Strategy:
  1. Repeat question (everyone hears it)
  2. "Great question" (acknowledge)
  3. Answer concisely (30-60 seconds)
  4. Bridge to strengths ("That relates to my decision on...")
  5. Move on ("Other questions?")

================================================================================
EMERGENCY CONTACTS
================================================================================

Demo won't run:       python validate_setup.py (diagnose)
Forgot line number:   race_engineer.py:17, 66, 163, 176
Forgot timing:        This card!
Went over time:       "Happy to discuss more offline"
Brain freeze:         "Let me show you in the code..." (buy time)

================================================================================
YOU GOT THIS! 🏁
